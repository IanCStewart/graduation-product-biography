I'm building a React Native version of my sketch prototype to see how far I can get with the front-end development process. During this process I will be getting a broader understanding of React Native and how to implement it.

## How?
I will set up a project using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). After this is done I'll start building the separate components. For now I will be working with mock data stored in json files instead of calling an API since there is no back-end yet.

## Result
After several weeks of coding it doesn't seem like i got real far. Even tho React Native carries the name React, it's still a total different framework. Because of these differences it has been several weeks of following tutorials and trying out different stuff to see what is possible.

To see my progress on this prototype head over to my [github repo](https://github.com/IanCStewart/ruis-loyalty-app) where all the code is stored.
