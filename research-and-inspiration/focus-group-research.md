# Doelgroep onderzoek
## Why?
> It is hard to design for users you do not fully understand. Interviews allow you to understand users better by gathering their opinions, behaviours, goals, attitudes and experiences. ~ HAN University of Applied Sciences - Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (z.d.)
