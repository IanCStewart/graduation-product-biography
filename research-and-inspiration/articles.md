# Read Articles
## Why?
During the process of my graduation project I will be reading up on some articles. These articles will be about matters needed for my project. By reading these articles i hope to get a better understanding of what ever I'm researching at that time.

## How?
I will be reading post on sites like [Medium.com](https://medium.com). To make notes while i read I will print the articles on 45% scale. This gives me a good amount of white space to make notes about what I'm reading.
