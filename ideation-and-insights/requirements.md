# Requirements list
## Why?
> To ensure your design meets all demands, a complete list of requirements can serve as a planning tool and checklist. ~ HAN University of Applied Sciences - Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (z.d.)

I'm composing a requirements list to figure out the following:
- What do users want off the app
- What does the client want off the app
- What technical features will be needed

## How?
I will Invite representative users and the client, ask what their needs are to compile this into a list of requirements.

## Conclusion
After the interviews I narrowed the list down to the following:

### Users
- Easy to use
- Premium look and feel
- Quick access to functionalities
- Foto albums of club nights
- Direct contact with club
- current deals/ saldo

### Client
- Facebook login/register
- Event calendar
- Loyalty ranking
- Collect club coins
- Tracking consumption in return of club coins
- Tracking visit in return of club coins
- Push notifications (about general stuff)
- Push notifications (about user specific stuff)
- Designed in Club Ruis identity

### Technical requirements
- Native app
- Mobile only
- Push notifications
- Facebook login/register
- Connection with cash register system
- Database (user data, events, etc.)
