# Inspirations
## Why?
> Save and organize creative ideas during a project, or even permanently, in order to have access to them very quickly and let ideas ‘simmer’ for a while. ~ HAN University of Applied Sciences - Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (z.d.)

## How?
I will collect inspiration from multiple platforms like [behance](https://www.behance.net), [dribbble](https://dribbble.com) & [pinterest](http://pinterest.com/).
